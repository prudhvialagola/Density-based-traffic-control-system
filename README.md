# Density-based-traffic-control-system
The project is designed to develop a density based traffic signal system.
Now a days traffic congestion has become a severe problem in many major cities across the world . 
The proposed model is mainly to overcome this problem. 
Here the signal timing changes automatically on sensing the traffic density at the junction.
Present conventional traffic light system is based on fixed time concept allotted to each side of the junction which can't be varied asper varying traffic density,it means junction timings are fixed.
Sometimes higher traffic density at one side of the junction demands longer green time as compared to standard allotted time.
The proposed system using a microcontroller of 8051 family duly interfaced with sensors,changes the junction timing automatically to
accomodate movement of vehicles smoothely,avoiding unnecessary waiting time at the junction.
